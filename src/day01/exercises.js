/*
 * DHSI 2019, Day 1 Exercises
 *
 * Here are a few programming challenges that ask you to write some functions
 * using what we learned in class today. All of these can be solved without
 * using Ramda, but they can also be solved more easily using Ramda's functions.
 *
 * You may need to consult Ramda's documentation (https://ramdajs.com/docs/) to
 * figure out what all these functions do.
 *
 * If you want an extra special challenge, you can use Ramda to write all of
 * these in point-free style
 * (http://randycoulman.com/blog/2016/06/21/thinking-in-ramda-pointfree-style/),
 * which is a way to earn some solid functional programming geek cred.
 *
 * Good luck!

/*
 * Exercise 1 - Lots of Smiles
 *
 * Write a function named `lotsOfSmiles` (and `export` it) that takes an array
 * of numbers and returns a string containing a number of smile emoji (ðŸ˜€)
 * equal to the sum of all the numbers.
 *
 */
export const lotsOfSmiles = (arrayOfNumbers) => [];

/*
 * Exercise 2 - Find Longest Word
 *
 * Write a function named `longestWord` (and `export` it) that takes a string
 * as a parameter and returns the longest word in the sentence. If there are
 * two or more words in the sentence of the same length, return the first
 * alphabetically.
 *
 */
export const longestWord = (sentence) => '';

/*
 * Exercise 3 - Reverse Strings in an Array
 *
 * Write a function named `reverseStrings` (and `export` it) that will take an
 * array and will, for each string in the array, reverse the string. The
 * function should not do anything to values that are not strings. Nor should
 * it throw an Error if it encounters a string.
 *

export const reverseStrings = (arrayOfMaybeWords) => [];
